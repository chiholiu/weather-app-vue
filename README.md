# Assignment
Develop a simple frontend application using best practices that calculates the average temperature forecast of a city.
The design is located here:
https://www.figma.com/file/AvW3g7PArmDFTYMp3TiTcb/Weather-app?node-id=6%3A212
Follow the provided design. On top you will have the input, on the bottom the results with live reload.
- [ ] A user should be able to enter the name of a city and a 2-letter country code. The application will lookup the weather forecast of that city.
- [ ] The application then averages the forecasted temperature of the next 10 days.
- [ ] It also displays the temperature for the next 7 days with the day (monday-sunday) and the corresponding temperature.
- [ ] Also the background has a gradient where the end point is the color attached to the average temperature on the next 10 days.
